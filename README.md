## Project Description:

### Problem:
The hotel chain faced significant challenges with its sales analysis, relying on static reports to assess bookings, revenue, and occupancy. This method resulted in delayed insights into cancellations, no-shows, and room performance, ultimately limiting the ability to make data-driven decisions.

### Solution: 
To address these issues, I developed a comprehensive and interactive Power BI dashboard that utilized DAX to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:  
- Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR),  
- Average Daily Rate (ADR),  
- Stay Ratio Number (SRN),  
- Daily Stay Ratio Number (DSRN),  
- Realization - Unit Revenue Number (URN),
              Base Revenue Number (BRN).  
This dynamic dashboard not only visualized revenue trends but also broke down performance by booking platforms and room types, providing a detailed analysis of the hotelâ€™s operational effectiveness.

### Impact:
The implementation of this dashboard enabled real-time insights into critical metrics, allowing management to quickly identify and address issues related to cancellations, no-shows, and underperforming properties. By presenting a clear picture of operational performance, the dashboard facilitated timely, informed decision-making, ultimately enhancing the hotel's revenue management strategies and improving overall profitability.
